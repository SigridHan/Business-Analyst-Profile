## Projects
* __Customer Behaivor Analysis Dashboard of Online Learning Platform__
  * __Description__: For 365 Data Science, an online learning platform, I worked with a users database of nearly 20,000 users, covering data from January to October 2022. Using SQL, I cleaned the dataset and extracted 11 clear tables to prepare the data for analysis. I then designed a five-page Tableau dashboard to analyze customer behavior, comparing engagement between free and paid users, tracking bounce rate trends across cohorts, examining exam participation, and identifying free-to-paid conversion patterns. This dashboard delivers deep, data-driven insights into user engagement and behavior.

* __Sentiment Analysis on Ecommerce Reviews__
  * __Description__:Our project analyzed over 9,000 Indian consumer reviews from Flipkart, the largest e-commerce platform in India, to conduct Sentiment Analysis and Topic Identification. We used the VADER Lexicon and trained a sentiment prediction model with scikit-learn, achieving an accuracy of 82.97%. The unstructured text was preprocessed using tokenization, annotation, lemmatization, stop word removal, non-text character filtering, HTML markup cleanup, and contraction expansion to form a structured dataset. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied for topic modeling, revealing key features driving consumer satisfaction. We visualized the topic distribution with pyLDAvis, achieving a high coherence score and providing actionable insights for product improvement.

* __Airbnb Rental and Property Sales Markets Analysis__
  * __Description__:This project analyzes Airbnb rental and property sales markets in California’s Big Bear and Joshua Tree regions (zip codes 92314, 92315, 92284, 92252) using a dataset with monthly aggregated data from 2019. It includes three primary files: a Market Analysis with listing-specific metrics (revenue, occupancy, pricing, stay duration, amenities), an Amenities file indicating presence or absence of specific property features, and a Geolocation file providing latitude and longitude for each listing. The analysis is visualized through a storyboard combining three dashboards: Dashboard 1 examines revenue and nightly rates by city and host type over time; Dashboard 2 focuses on detailed amenities and maps each listing’s location; and Dashboard 3 delves into revenue per guest, popular streets, and guest distribution by city and host type. These dashboards offer valuable insights into trends and customer preferences, aiding potential hosts considering rentals in these areas.

* __Flight Delays in the 2021 US Airports__
  * __Description__:This report presents an in-depth analysis of flight delays in US airports for 2021, using a structured dataset of 1.89 GB. The study focuses on factors such as airlines, months, departure locations, and shared partner flights, aiming to identify patterns in flight delays. Utilizing __PySpark and Random Forest algorithms__, the analysis highlights the variance in delay frequencies among different airlines and months, and the impact of departure locations and shared partner flights. In addition, this analysis uses random forest to __predict the likelihood of delay__ given certain factors. The findings are intended to guide travelers and stakeholders in making informed decisions to minimize delays, thereby enhancing efficiency and reliability in air travel. The recommendations provided are based on data-driven insights, offering practical solutions to common travel dilemmas such as choosing between airlines for timely arrivals.
