## Projects
* __Customer Behaivor Analysis Dashboard of Online Learning Platform__
  * __Description__: For 365 Data Science, an online learning platform, I worked with a users database of over 20,000 users, covering data from January to October 2022. Using SQL, I cleaned the dataset and extracted 11 clear tables to prepare the data for analysis. I then designed a five-page Tableau dashboard to analyze customer behavior, comparing engagement between free and paid users, tracking bounce rate trends across cohorts, examining exam participation, and identifying free-to-paid conversion patterns. This dashboard delivers deep, data-driven insights into user engagement and behavior.
